Fun and simple file storage :) This application is a mock Google Drive that enables the client to create an account, sign in, and drop their files as needed and attach an option caption to each one. Users can perform CRUD operations with uploading, opening, updating, and removing their files. The app's storage leverages Amazon's S3 solution.

After inputting valid details, the client will be given a unique authentification code to confirm their email address.

### Sign In View

After successful account creation, users will then be asked to sign in - they have been added to the pool in AWS Cognito.

### Home View (View Files View)

After being authenticated, you will be directed to the home screen where you can view all of your uploaded files. From here, you can download, edit, and/or delete your files to how you want it!

### Drop File View

Upon heading over to `drop file` users will be greeted with this page where they can either drag and drop their files or manually click `Choose File` where they will be able to select their file from their local file manager.
- Note: `what should we call this?` and `what is this?` is completely **optional**.
